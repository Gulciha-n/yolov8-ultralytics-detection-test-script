# YOLOv8 Ultralytics Detection Test with PyTorch

This repository contains a script for performing object detection using a YOLOv8 model. The script applies the model to given images, saves detection results to text files, and annotates images with bounding boxes, class labels, and confidence scores.

## Features

- **YOLOv8 Model**: Utilizes a pretrained YOLOv8 detection model for object detection tasks.
- **Detection Results**: Saves detection results to text files with bounding box coordinates, class labels, and confidence scores.
- **Image Annotation**: Annotates images with bounding boxes, class labels, and confidence scores, and saves them.

## Installation

To run this script, you'll need to have the following dependencies installed:

- **Python 3**
- **Ultralytics YOLO**: Install via `pip install ultralytics`
- **OpenCV**: Install via `pip install opencv-python`

You can install the required Python packages using:

```bash
pip install ultralytics opencv-python
```
